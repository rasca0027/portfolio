A game I made during [Global Game Jam 19](https://globalgamejam.org/). This game got the *Best Impact Award* at the NYU Game Center jam site.  

This game is about a starving game dev trying to get a working Visa to stay in the US. You have 28 weeks until submitting the Visa application... Can you get that visa?
