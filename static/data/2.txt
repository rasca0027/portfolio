## What It Is
Fimbulwinter is a post-apocalyptic survival board game aiming to raise awareness of political engagement.  

Each player play as a survivor living in a basecamp, and the world is a cold, dead place with ashed flying in ruins. The goal of the game is to survive through three months until the rescue arrives.

Fimbulwinter was originally called *No One is an Outsider*, and is my thesis project for Integrated Digital Media program at New York University. The research behind the game is trying to send out a social message that encourages players to participate more in politics and social issues.

This is a game about dilemma of contribution to the community and your own resources. Players will learn the subtle message behind the game: you have to care more about your society, before it's too late. Under the current political climate, this is all the more relevant.

## Characters

To create immersive gameplay experience, players are encouraged to role-play. There are five characters in the game: Soldier, Doctor, Engineer, Grandpa and Little girl.

Different characters have different personality traits and status: health points and action points. Action points are for contributing to the community, and health points are basically life points, if it goes down to zero, players die.

## Event Cards

Players have to survive three months, in which there will be one event each week. 

For each event, players have to cooperatively spend their action tokens to resolve the situation, otherwise they will suffer from penalties. Penalties are trait-based, which creates tension and randomness in the gameplay.

## Playtest

Players report that the game is enjoyable and would like to play again. 

They did not realize the game was about politics, which is intentional because it matches the design guideline "Obfuscating" from *Embedded Design*. However, they did learn the message from the game and agree to participate more in communities.
