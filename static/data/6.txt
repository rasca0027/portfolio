Handshaking
code art

Handshaking is an interactive installation which explores the link between human behavior and computer science theories. When we meet new people, we shake hands with them. There is also a protocol called 'Three Way Handshaking' in computer science. I try to connect these two things, and make a physical interface for humans to meet computer programs.

When you shake hands with the fake hand on the table, you are interacting with a computer program. After you establish the connection, you are able to interact with the AI-like figure built with WebGL and 3-D points cloud.
